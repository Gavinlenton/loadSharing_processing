# MOtoNMS: Test Data #

This folder includes several datasets with the objective to give new users a 
way to get familiar with MOtoNMS and as an example on how to setup new 
laboratory and experimental configurations. 

The datasets are from four laboratories with different instrumentations:

- GU:    Centre of Musculoskeletal Research, Griffith University,
         Goald Cost, Australia
- UMG:   Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, Georg August University, 
         Gottingen, Germany 
- UNIPD: Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, 
         Padova, Italy
- UWA:   School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, University of Western 
         Australia, Perth, Australia

InputData contains the collected motion data stored as C3D files 
from the four laboratories. 

ElaboratedData contains the results of a few example of elaborations 
performed with MOtoNMS. New users can try to use MOtoNMS to replicate 
these outputs and/or open these files with OpenSim to check possible 
MOtoNMS outputs.

This directory also show how folders should be organized and which files 
should be stored in each subfolder.
